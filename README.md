## Context
This app is developed as part of an academic project in 2018. Currently, we are working on improving the app to enhance its features and functionality, using best practices and clean code to ensure the app's quality and maintainability.
## Topic
This application virtualizes popular multi-player strategy games, such as hangman, tic tac toe, and dice games, which were traditionally played with paper, pencil, or specific game materials. The advantage of this dematerialized mobile version is that it requires only basic technical prerequisites and doesn't need an internet connection, unlike video games. Additionally, compared to traditional games, it offers greater flexibility, allowing you to play comfortably from the comfort of your sofa, without any material consumption or environmental pollution.
